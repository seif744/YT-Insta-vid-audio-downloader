# YT-Insta-vid-audio-downloader
Audio downloads will be in webm, convert them to mp4 using any online converter.
While inputting a YouTube URL, do not include anything beyond the video ID (comes right after /watch?v=)

You must also choose the path you want your video to save. It saves out of onedrive on the desktop and creates a file by itself if you do not want to create a file. (The default file name it will create is 'Bideo').
